# RepoPilot VS Code Extension - Quick Start

## 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python run.py
```
Backend will run at http://localhost:8000

## 2. Run the Extension
- Open `vscode-extension` folder in VS Code
- Press **F5** to launch Extension Development Host
- A new VS Code window opens with the extension loaded

## 3. Test the Extension
In the new window:
1. Open a workspace folder (your project)
2. Click the RepoPilot icon in the activity bar
3. Wait for auto-indexing to complete
4. Type a question and click Send

## Troubleshooting
- **Backend not connected**: Make sure step 1 is complete
- **Indexing fails**: Check backend logs for errors
- **No icon in activity bar**: Reload the extension window
